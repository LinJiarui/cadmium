Cadmium is a python library for Solid Modelling

Cadmium allows you to write python code to create primitive objects (Box, Cylinder, Sphere, etc.) and apply CSG operations (Addition, Subtraction, Intersection) on them to create advanced solid models. The primitives have support for affine transformations too (translation, rotation).

Here are [Screenshots](http://jayesh3.github.com/cadmium/) of the STL file generated by [example cadmium scripts](https://github.com/jayesh3/cadmium/tree/master/examples). (as viewed in MeshLab)

Typical Solid modelling code with Cadmium
------------------------------------------
    import sys
    import math
    from cadmium import Box, Cylinder

    box = Box(x=4, y=4, z=4)
    box.rotate([0,0,1], 30*math.pi/180)
    cyl = Cylinder(radius=2, height=4)
    cyl.translate([-1,0,0])

    solid = box + cyl

    fd = open(sys.argv[1], 'w')
    fd.write(solid.toSTL())
    fd.close()

Building Cadmium
---------------------------
Assumes CGAL 3.8 is installed in /usr/local/
You need to have [SCons](http://www.scons.org/) for this step

    cd cadmium
    scons

If you don't have Scons, try this

    g++ -o src/cgal-wrapper/csgop.os -c -fPIC -I/usr/local/include src/cgal-wrapper/csgop.cpp
    g++ -o build/libcsgop.so -shared src/cgal-wrapper/csgop.os -L/usr/local/lib -lCGAL

Running example code
---------------------

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib python example/<python-script> <filename.stl>

Details
--------------------------
Cadmium is inspired by the [OpenSCAD project](http://www.openscad.org/), but it is an independent implementation. Here is what is different about Cadmium.

* Write your code in Python. No need to learn new syntax. Use your favorite python features as you do advanced calculations for solid modelling.
* Cadmium has no GUI. It only generates STL files (other formats may be supported in future). You can view these STL files in your favorite STL viewer, on your favorite OS. Becase Cadmium has no GUI, it's very light weight and has minimal dependencies. Hence it should be portable to any platform that compiles C/C++
* Most of the Cadmium code is written in Python. There is only a thin layer of C/C++ code (<200 lines) that makes calls into CGAL.

Cadmium is a work in progress. There are bugs, mainly because of my limited understanding of CGAL. They will be fixed with time. Patches and suggestsions are welcome.

Building and Installing CGAL 
-----------------------------
The only dependency that Cadmium has is `CGAL`.
Download [CGAL-3.8](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=52)

    unzip CGAL-3.8.zip
    cd CGAL-3.8
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make
    sudo make install
